//Theory
A NOR gate (“not OR gate”) is a logic gate that produces a high output (1) only if all its inputs are false, and low output (0) otherwise. Hence the NOR gate is the inverse of an OR gate, and its circuit is 
produced by connecting an OR gate to a NOT gate. Just like an OR gate, a NOR gate may have any number of input probes but only one output probe.

//Theory
A Binary-to-BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) converter is a combinational circuit that takes a binary number as input and converts it into its equivalent BCD 
representation. BCD is a binary encoding scheme where each decimal digit is represented by a four-bit binary code.

Here's the theory behind a Binary-to-BCD converter:

1. Inputs: The Binary-to-BCD converter takes a binary number as input. The size of the input depends on the maximum decimal value that the converter needs to 
handle. For example, if the converter needs to handle decimal numbers up to 99, then the input would typically be an 8-bit binary number.

2. Conversion Process: The conversion process involves separating the binary number into its decimal digits and encoding each digit using BCD.
(i) Divide the input binary number into groups of four bits, starting from the least significant bits. Each group represents a decimal digit.
(ii) Convert each four-bit group into its equivalent BCD representation using a truth table or a set of logic gates. BCD uses the binary representation of decimal
digits, where each decimal digit (0-9) is represented by a four-bit binary code.
(iii) Combine the BCD representations of the individual decimal digits to obtain the overall BCD representation of the input binary number.

3. Outputs: The Binary-to-BCD converter generates output lines representing the BCD representation of the input binary number. Typically, four output lines are
used to represent each decimal digit. For example, in an 8-bit Binary-to-BCD converter, the output would consist of four sets of four lines, representing the BCD
codes of the two decimal digits.

4. Cascading: For larger binary numbers, multiple Binary-to-BCD converters can be cascaded together. The output of one converter serves as input to the next 
higher-order converter. This cascading technique allows for converting binary numbers of larger sizes into their BCD representations.

The Binary-to-BCD converter is a widely used circuit in applications where decimal representation is required, such as in digital displays, decimal arithmetic 
operations, and data encoding. It allows for converting binary numbers into their BCD equivalents, making it easier to handle decimal values in digital systems.

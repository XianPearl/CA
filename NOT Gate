//Theory
A NOT gate is a logic gate that inverts the digital input signal. For this reason, a NOT gate is sometimes is referred to as an inverter (not to be confused with a
power inverter). A NOT gate always has high (logical 1) output when its input is low (logical 0). Conversely, a logical NOT gate always has low (logical 0) output
when the input is high (logical 1).
